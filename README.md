# NextBite

NextBite is an AI chatbot designed to help people turn their leftover foods into delicious recipes without needing to buy new ingredients. One of the biggest issues in todayâ€™s modern age is food waste, and we aim to reduce it by encouraging people to use what they already have to create new meals. 

Project Managers/Developers: Diana Montero & Joshua Moore.
