# NextBite

NextBite is an AI chatbot designed to help people turn their leftover foods into delicious recipes without needing to buy new ingredients. One of the biggest issues in todayâ€™s modern age is food waste, and we aim to reduce it by encouraging people to use what they already have to create new meals. 

Project Managers/Developers: Diana Montero & Joshua Moore

Description of AI Model: NextBite uses Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash pretrained LLM that is designed to generate new content (like recipes) based on user's inputs. Additionally, it uses the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model for understanding language by converting text into vectors.
